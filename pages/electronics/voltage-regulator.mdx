# Voltage Regulator Component

- They are electronic elements that output a constant voltage regardless of the input.
- The input voltage must be greater than the output voltage
- They are widely used in designing power supply circuits and voltage sources (Power Supply).

Voltage regulators typically have three legs, one for ground and separate inputs and outputs.

## Types

Voltage regulators are commonly identified by part numbers like 7805, 7806, etc., indicating their input and output voltage specifications.

| **Type** | **Min Input Voltage** | **Output Voltage** |
|:--------:|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
|   7805   |           7V          |         +5V        |
|   7806   |           8V          |         +6V        |
|   7808   |          10V          |        +10V        |
|   7809   |          11V          |        +11V        |
|   7812   |          15V          |        +15V        |
|   7815   |          18V          |        +18V        |
|   7818   |          22V          |        +22V        |
|   7824   |          30V          |        +30V        |

Voltage regulators are essential components in various electronic devices, providing stable and reliable voltage regulation for optimal performance.
