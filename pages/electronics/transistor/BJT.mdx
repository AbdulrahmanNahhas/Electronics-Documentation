# Introduction to BJT transistors

**Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)** are three-terminal semiconductor devices that can be used as amplifiers or switches. BJTs are made of two types of semiconductor material: `n-type` and `p-type`. The `n-type` material has an excess of electrons, while the `p-type` material has a deficiency of electrons.

The three terminals of a BJT are the `base`, `emitter`, and `collector`. The `base` is the control terminal, and the `emitter` and `collector` are the output terminals. When a `small current` is applied to the base, it can cause a `much larger current` to flow between the emitter and collector. This is how BJTs can be used as amplifiers.

BJTs are also used as switches. When the `base current` is turned off, the `collector current` is also turned off. This makes BJTs ideal for applications where a `small current` can be used to control a `large current`.

## Types of BJT transistors

There are two main types of BJT transistors: `NPN` and `PNP`. `NPN transistors` have an `n-type base`, an `n-type emitter`, and a `p-type collector`. `PNP transistors` have a `p-type base`, a `p-type emitter`, and an `n-type collector`.

## Applications of BJT transistors

BJT transistors are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

- **Amplifiers**
- **Switches**
- **Oscillators**
- **Logic gates**
- **Comparators**
- **Buffers**
- **Linearizers**

## Biasing of BJT transistors

In order for a BJT transistor to work properly, it must be biased. `Biasing` means applying a `small current` to the base to ensure that the transistor is always in either the `on` or `off` state. There are two main types of biasing:

- **Forward biasing**
- **Reverse biasing**

**Forward biasing** is when the `base-emitter junction` is forward biased. This means that the `positive terminal` of the voltage source is connected to the `base`, and the `negative terminal` of the voltage source is connected to the `emitter`.

**Reverse biasing** is when the `base-emitter junction` is reverse biased. This means that the `positive terminal` of the voltage source is connected to the `emitter`, and the `negative terminal` of the voltage source is connected to the `base`.

## Characteristics of BJT transistors

There are several important characteristics of BJT transistors, including:

- **Current gain**
- **Voltage gain**
- **Input impedance**
- **Output impedance**
- **Switching speed**

`Current gain` is the ratio of the `collector current` to the `base current`. `Voltage gain` is the ratio of the change in `collector voltage` to the change in `base voltage`. `Input impedance` is the resistance to the flow of current into the base. `Output impedance` is the resistance to the flow of current out of the collector. `Switching speed` is the time it takes for a BJT transistor to switch from the `on state` to the `off state`, or vice versa.

## Troubleshooting BJT transistors

If a BJT transistor is not working properly, there are a few things that you can check:

- Make sure that the transistor is properly biased.
- Check the connections to the transistor.
- Check the transistor for damage.

If you have checked all of these things and the transistor is still not working properly, then you may need to replace it.
