# What is a Transistor?

Transistors are small electronic components used extensively in electronic circuits for two main functions:
1. **Switching:** Transistors act as switches, allowing current to flow or preventing it from flowing through a circuit. By controlling the current flow, transistors can turn circuits on and off rapidly, making them essential for digital logic and microcontroller applications.
2. **Amplification:** Transistors also serve as amplifiers, where a small input signal can be used to control a much larger output signal. This property is vital for signal processing and audio amplification in various electronic devices.

## Types of Transistors

Transistors can be broadly categorized into two main types:
