# What is a Transistor?

Transistors are small electronic components used extensively in electronic circuits for two main functions:

1. **Switching:** Transistors act as switches, allowing current to flow or preventing it from flowing through a circuit. By controlling the current flow, transistors can turn circuits on and off rapidly, making them essential for digital logic and microcontroller applications.
2. **Amplification:** Transistors also serve as amplifiers, where a small input signal can be used to control a much larger output signal. This property is vital for signal processing and audio amplification in various electronic devices.

## Types of Transistors

There are two main types of transistors:

### Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT)

BJTs are three-layer semiconductor devices with two types: **NPN** and **PNP** transistors. They consist of a thin, lightly doped layer (base) sandwiched between two heavily doped layers (emitter and collector). BJT transistors are commonly used in digital logic circuits, amplifiers, and switching applications.

### Field-Effect Transistor (FET)

FETs are three-terminal devices that use an electric field to control the flow of current. They are categorized into two types: **Junction Field-Effect Transistors (JFETs)** and **Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs)**. FETs find extensive use in integrated circuits, power amplifiers, and high-frequency applications.
