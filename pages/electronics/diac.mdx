## What is a Diac?

It is an electronic component that is very similar to a diode, but there are two differences:
1. A Diac can conduct current in both directions.
2. a Diac has no anode, cathode but A1, A2.

But the diak needs a voltage <span style={{color:"hsl(var(--nextra-primary-hue)100% 60%/var(--tw-text-opacity))"}}>greater than the diode voltage (0.7)</span> to move to the ON state
