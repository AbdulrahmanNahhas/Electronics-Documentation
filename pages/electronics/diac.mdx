## What is a Diac?

It is an electronic component that is very similar to a diode, but there are two differences:
1. A DIAC can conduct current in <span style={{color:"hsl(var(--nextra-primary-hue)100% 60%/var(--tw-text-opacity))"}}>both directions</span>.
2. The DIAC needs a voltage <span style={{color:"hsl(var(--nextra-primary-hue)100% 60%/var(--tw-text-opacity))"}}>greater than the diode voltage (0.7)</span> to move to the ON state

## Diac Symbol

The DIAC symbol used to depict this electronic component in circuit diagrams can be remembered as a combination of what may appear to be two diodes in parallel with each other but connected in opposite directions.

The Diac has no anode, cathode but A1, A2 (Anode 1, Anode 2) or MT1, MT2.
