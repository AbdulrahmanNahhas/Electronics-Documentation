## Switches: Introduction and Types

Switches are fundamental electronic components used to control the flow of current in a circuit by opening or closing the electrical pathway. They serve as the basic building blocks for various electronic and electrical systems, enabling manual or automatic control over devices.

## Types of Switches:

1. **Toggle Switch:** A simple mechanical switch with a lever or toggle that can be moved between ON and OFF positions. 

2. **Push Button Switch:** A momentary switch that completes the circuit only when the button is pressed, returning to the OFF state when released.

3. **Slide Switch:** A compact switch that moves a slider to open or close the circuit.

4. **Rotary Switch:** A switch with a rotating knob that selects different positions to establish various connections.

5. **DIP Switch:** Dual In-line Package switch, commonly used for setting electronic configurations or parameters.

6. **Reed Switch:** A magnetic switch activated by the presence or absence of a magnetic field.

7. **Proximity Sensor:** An electronic switch that detects the presence or absence of an object without physical contact.
