## What is a Triac?

- A Triac is an electronic component that closely resembles a thyristor but has the ability to conduct current in both directions.
- It has three terminals: Gate, MT1, and MT2.
- The Triac can be triggered into conduction by applying either a positive or negative pulse to the Gate terminal.

## How does a Triac Work?

The Triac switches to an OFF state under the following conditions:

1. When the voltage across the Triac becomes reverse-biased, meaning the positive voltage becomes negative and vice versa.
2. When the power supply is completely removed.
3. By shorting the two terminals of the Triac using a small resistor or a switch.
