## What is a Triac?

- A Triac is an electronic component that closely resembles a thyristor but has the ability to conduct current in both directions.
- It has three terminals: Gate, MT1, and MT2.
- The Triac can be triggered into conduction by applying either a positive or negative pulse to the Gate terminal.
