## What is a Thyristor?

A thyristor, also known as a Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR), is a semiconductor device.

The diode allows current to flow from the Anode to the Cathode if the Anode voltage is greater than the Cathode voltage by approximately 0.7 volts. However, this behavior is different in the thyristor.

In the thyristor, current will only pass if a single pulse is applied to the Gate. Once triggered, the thyristor will conduct like a wire.

## Understanding How the Thyristor Works

1. The thyristor can be controlled through the Gate.
2. Applying a positive pulse to the Gate will put the thyristor in an ON state.
3. When the thyristor is in an ON state, it operates like a diode.
4. If the pulse is removed from the Gate, the thyristor remains in an active state.
5. The thyristor switches to an OFF state when the voltage on the Anode becomes negative, or when the power source is completely removed, or by shorting the Cathode and Anode using a small resistor or switch.
6. The thyristor will also turn OFF if a weak current flows through it, known as the minimum holding current (Ih).

## Thyristor Symbol

The image above depicts the symbol used to represent a thyristor in circuit diagrams. It consists of three terminals: Anode, Cathode, and Gate. The Anode and Cathode terminals represent the main current-carrying paths, while the Gate terminal is used to control the thyristor's operation. This symbol simplifies the representation of the thyristor's complex internal structure and facilitates its integration into various electronic circuits.
